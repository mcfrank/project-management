This is an example of an RMarkdown script that could be built out into a paper. 

We might use the `papaja` package to make it into a reproducible paper. 

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(here)

exp1 <- read_csv("data/exp1/data.csv")
```


```{r}
ggplot(exp1, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()
```
